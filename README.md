Hi I am friendlyLight, a network engineeering student. 
This GitHub repo will be mainly be recording my journey
to become a network engineering and also show case my 
networking skills up to the CCNA standard. 

Inside the CCNA section will contain diagrams and explantion 
of network topologies and elements related to CCNA modules.
Additionally, I will also include the packet tracer files that 
I have created for explanation within the CCNA section.
